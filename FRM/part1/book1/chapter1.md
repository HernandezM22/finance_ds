# 1. The building blocks of risk management

## What is risk?

Risk, fundamentally, is the prossibility that bad things happen. 

Most risk management dissasters are cause by the failure to recognize or deal with the 10 building blocks of risk, those being:

1. The risk management process

2. Identifying risk: knowns and unknowns

3. Expected loss, unexpected loss and tail loss

4. Risk factor breakdown

5. Structural change, from tail risk to systemic crisis

6. Human agency and conflicts of interest

7. Typology of risks and risk interactions

8. Risk aggregations

9. Balancing risk and reward

10. Enterprise risk management

## 1.1 Typology of risks and risk interactions

A general typology of risk can be considered. However, depending on the industry, only some types of risk will be present. Each specific type of risk require a specific set of skills and its own philosophical approach. 

This typology is constantly evolving because risk types are constantly being created or deprecated.

Risk in an industry can flow from a type to another. For example, during a severe crisis, risk can flow from credit risk to liquidity risk, to market risk (which happened during the global financial crisis of 2007-2009)

### Market Risk

Market risk is related to the continuous change of prices and rates, which causes the values of securities and other assets to be volatile. These movements create the potential for loss.

Again, depending on the industry, market risk manifests differently. However, across all markets, market risk is driven by:

* **General Market Risk**: The risk than an asset class will fall in value, leading to a fall in the value of an individual asset or portfolio.

* **Specific Market Risk**: The risk of an individual asset will fall in value more than the general asset class.

Market risk is usually managed through the relationships between positions. Diversification is an important part of that. For example, jet fuel price can be hedged taking into account the relationship between crude oil's price and jet fuel's price, but, in case that relationship were to change, the hedge might fail by becoming ineffective or worse, resulting in a greater loss than if no hedge was placed.

### Credit Risk

This type of risk arises form the failure of one party to fulfill it's financial obligations to another party. For example:

* Failing to pay interest or principal (Bankruptcy risk)

* The counterparty is downgraded (Downgrade risk). Which results in loss of value of a credit-linked security

* A counterparty to a market trade fails to perform

It has some main levers:

* Probability of default by counterparty

* The exposure amount at the time of default

* The amount that can be recovered in the event of a default

This risk is usually managed taking into account several factors such as the quality of the borrowers, the structure of the credit instrument, and protective covenants in favor or the lender.

In general, a portfolio will be riskier if:

* It has a small number of large loans intead of many small ones

* The returns or default probabilities are positively correlated

* The exposure amount, probability of default and loss given default amounts are positively correlated.
